# DevelopmentTools

A collection of different tools that use.

### Change .gitconfigure file

I use two different git hub accounts for the different projects. In the Eclipse IDE is not easy to change the author before uploading the source changes.
That the reason I made this tool.

The button 'Change Config Path' is to select the folder of the .configure file. After defining this path, the tool 
will searching for other files with the suffix .gitconfigure. 
The founded files are selectable over the combobox in the top of the border pane. After the selection of a item from the combobox, the 
content of file will be displayed in the center of the pane. The button 'Use select config' is to replace the content of the original .gitconfigure
whith the selected gitconfigure file.
